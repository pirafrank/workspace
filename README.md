# dotfiles

My dotfiles, simple as that.

This is a WIP and I'll add files from time to time. My usage scenario is same repo and settings for:

- macbook
- linux desktop
- linux env accessed via mosh connection on ipad

cygwin support *may* come later on.

### Installation

just clone it to your home dir and symlink all the things.

### Usage

There is no how-to. Look at the code. Google is your friend.

### License

Some files and scripts in the *bin* folder come from some other repo of mine. I am going to continue to maintain them here first. These will get the same license they had due to GNU GPL v3 restrictions.
All the rest is given away for free. By the way, if something really blows your mind, I'll be happy if you cite me.

And most importantly, 
this come with NO WARRANTY.

Enjoy!
