# dotfiles

My dotfiles, simple as that.

This is a WIP and I'll add files from time to time. My usage scenario is same repo and settings for:

- macbook
- linux desktop
- linux server accessed via mosh connection on ipad

Cygwin support may come later on. [Or may not](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

## Installation

just clone it to your home dir and symlink all the things.

## Usage

There is no how-to. Look at the code. Google is your friend.

## Credits

#### Scripts

Some files in the `bin` folder may come or contain pieces from the web (twitter? google? stackoverflow?). Onestly I can't remember where I got them from, but the original author should be in the comments.

#### Themes

Those without *pirafrank* in their name come from the web, credits go to their creators. I keep them here for the sake of simplicity. I'll try to keep this readme updated to keep them all.

- vim themes
  - [*noctu*](https://github.com/noahfrederick/vim-noctu)
  - [*dim*](https://github.com/jeffkreeftmeijer/vim-dim)
- *themerdev*-prefixed themes come from [themer.dev](https://themer.dev/).

## License

Many of the files and scripts in the `bin` folder come from some other repos of mine. Although those repositories are publicly available on GitHub, I am going to continue to maintain them in `dotfiles`. These file will get the same license they had (GNU GPL v3).

All the rest is given away for free, as-is and with NO WARRANTY. 

By the way, if something really blows your mind, I'll be happy if you cite me.

Enjoy!
