# Azure Container Instances

A few notes.

Scripts are meant to be a getting started boilerplate and are not ready to be run.

You have to modify them to fit your needs.

An Azure Subscription is required to use the Container Instances service.

I am not a Microsoft affiliate in any way.

Please, always check code before you run it!

## Tip

You can save those scripts in your `Azure Cloud Shell` home dir for easy recovery, e.g. to launch them on-the-go by using Cloud Shell in Azure mobile apps.
